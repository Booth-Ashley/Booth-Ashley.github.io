However, recent developments have ignited concerns among its user base, potentially jeopardizing the trust that has been foundational to its success.\nConcerns Over New Terms of Use #\rOn February 25, 2025, Mozilla introduced updated Terms of Use for Firefox. A particular clause has raised eyebrows:\n\u0026ldquo;When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.\u0026rdquo; (Mozilla)\nThis language has led users to question the extent of data Mozilla collects and how it is utilized. Discussions on Mozilla\u0026rsquo;s community forums reflect a growing unease, with users expressing concerns about potential overreach and the implications for their personal data.\nUser comment on Mozilla Forums\rDisappearing Promises #\rUsers have also flagged subtle but alarming modifications to Firefox’s official FAQ page, reinforcing concerns about Mozilla’s evolving stance on privacy.\nOne user highlighted a notable change in how Mozilla describes its business model. Previously, the FAQ explicitly assured users:\n“You don’t pay anything to use it, and we don’t sell your personal data.”\nHowever, this statement has been quietly altered to remove the reassurance about personal data sales, now simply reading:\n“You don’t pay anything to use it.”\nUser comment on Mozilla Forums\rAdding to the suspicion, a recent commit (d459add) removed an entire FAQ entry addressing whether Firefox sells user data. Previously, Mozilla had unequivocally stated:\n\u0026ldquo;Nope. Never have, never will. And we protect you from many of the advertisers who do. Firefox products are designed to protect your privacy. That’s a promise.\u0026rdquo;\nNow, that promise has disappeared.\nFor privacy-conscious users, these silent deletions speak louder than any official statements. Many are left wondering: If Mozilla’s commitment to privacy hasn’t changed, why remove these reassurances?\nCommit changes\rErosion of Trust #\rThese developments have led to a erosion of trust among Firefox\u0026rsquo;s user base. Historically, Mozilla has differentiated itself by offering enhanced user privacy and transparency. The perception that the company may be compromising these principles could result in users migrating to alternative browsers.\nFor Mozilla, the stakes are high. A dwindling user base not only affects its market share but also its influence in advocating for an open and privacy-respecting internet. To mitigate potential damage, Mozilla may need to revisit its recent policy changes, engage transparently with its community, and reaffirm its commitment to the values that once set it apart in the crowded browser market.\nAlternative Browsers #\rIf you are looking for an alternative browser, i reccomend you check out the following to see if they are right for you:\nBrave Ladybird ","date":"27 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/the-end-of-firefox/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Is This the Beginning of the End for Firefox?","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"27 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"27 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/reccomended/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Reccomended","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"27 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"27 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/technology/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Technology","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/android/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Android","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/ebay/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Ebay","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/refurbished/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Refurbished","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"26 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/review/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Review","type":"categories"},{"content":"\rA Dead Pixel #\rMy wife\u0026rsquo;s Google Pixel 6 Pro had taken a few tumbles more than it could handle recently and was having display issues.\n3 quarters of the screen was blacking out and flickering most of the time, it\u0026rsquo;s a miracle it\u0026rsquo;s still going but i needed to sort it out in case it died at a critical time.\nBroken Google Pixel 6 Pro\rI had a few solutions in mind:\n1. Order a new screen from eBay (60£)\nThe screen does not come with the fingerprint scanner; it would need to be transferred over from the old device and recalibrate using googles computer software. 2. Order a new screen from AliExpress (£30)\nsame as above, would need to transfer the fingerprint sensor and there is no telling if it would even work with the AliExpress screen 3. Buy a brand-new phone\nNew flagships these days go for around £1000, and the advancements lately have all just been AI hype, there is not really much in terms of upgrades at the moment. 4. Buy another Pixel 6 Pro (Refurbished)\nUltimately this is what i settled with, the wife had enjoyed her short time with the pixel and was happy with another. I may still buy the screen from AliExpress anyway and replace it so i can use the broken pixel for development projects i have in mind.\n(I currently have my old Samsung Galaxy Note 8 running a home CCTV system)\nPixel Hunting #\rNow i just needed to find a good price, my regular place for purchasing refurbished phones was MusicMagpie, but for some reason they no longer sold the Pixel 6 Pro, earliest was the Pixel 7 Pro for £220 in their lowest tier \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; condition.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a shame since i have always had a good experience with the quality of their refurbishments. My S22 Ultra was in their lowest tier marked as \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; and was in such \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; condition that it still had the manufacture\u0026rsquo;s protective stickers on the sides of the device.\nHunting around other refurbishment stores found multiple prices all varying between the £140-£250 range.\nThe iOutlet #\rI came across The iOutlet on eBay, the same model and colour as the broken one for £169.99 in \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; condition.\nI checked their recent feedback on phones marked in the same condition to see customer reviews, all were positive that I could see so I went ahead with the purchase.\nThe phone was posted out the next working day and delivered the day after.\nIt came with a free USB-A to USB-C Cable for charging, a sim pin ejector and a few leaflets and a sticker stating the battery health was 87%.\nThe Condition #\rThe iOutlet has 4 different conditions listed:\n1. A+ Grade – Pristine\nLike new condition used product with no signs of wear. Item has been fully tested in full working order. 2. A Grade – Excellent\nExcellent condition used product with little or minor signs of wear. Item has been fully tested in full working order. 3. B Grade – Good\nGood condition used product that will show moderate signs of wear across the device. Item has been fully tested and in full working order. 4. C Grade – Average\nAverage condition used product that will show signs of heavy wear but has been fully tested and in full working order. Good condition? #\rUpon inspecting the overall condition of the device, the sides had very noticeable dints, chips and scuffs to it. the backside had plenty of blemish\u0026rsquo;s. Not a deal breaker since it will be spending the majority of its life inside a case however i did think the scuffs around the sides were more than \u0026ldquo;moderate wear\u0026rdquo;\nThe display has many light scratches you would expect from such an old device, the types of scratches you could only see if positioning a certain way to see the light reflecting off them, however in the centre left of the screen there was a noticeable deeper scratch, one that it a lot more noticeable.\nThe Verdict #\rDon\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong for this price the flagship pixel is still a steal! However, i did feel like the condition was nowhere near as good as what MusicMagpie offers.\nIn my opinion this B Grade \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; would suit more of a C Grade \u0026ldquo;Average\u0026rdquo;, It just isn\u0026rsquo;t in \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; condition in any way shape or form.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to think if i tried to sell this to someone and told them it\u0026rsquo;s in \u0026ldquo;Good\u0026rdquo; condition i wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get very far with the sale.\nWhile you get what you pay for is certainly a term that applies here, I can\u0026rsquo;t help but wonder if there was maybe a mistake at The iOutlet and they sent me a lower quality device by accident, I\u0026rsquo;ve had refurbished mobiles from MusicMagpie, CEX and other\u0026rsquo;s before but this is currently the worst quality i have experienced.\nIt will still do the job, certainly not worth the hassle returning, although they did include a returns slip so I\u0026rsquo;m sure the process would be simple.\nStill, it\u0026rsquo;s much better than the old Pixel, and it was never supposed to be an upgrade. Just a quick fix.\nI will probably avoid going back for another device in the future and stick to MusicMagpie going forward, So far, they have been the best value for money especially when taking advantage of eBay 20% off coupon sales.\n","date":"26 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/the-ioutlet-review/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The iOutlet Refurbished Pixel 6 Pro Review","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"14 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/cnc/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"CNC","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"14 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/designs/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Designs","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"14 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/diy/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"DIY","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rToday, I\u0026rsquo;m sharing a collection of car keyrings I\u0026rsquo;ve designed, available in the .DXF file format, ready for CNC cutting.\nCar logo\u0026rsquo;s in this collection:\nToyota Citroen Tesla Peugeot The overall measurements of the keyrings in millimeters\rDownload #\rYou can download the .DXF file for free from here.\nIf you enjoy my work and want to support me, feel free to make a donation.\nIf you would like to commission a custom design from me, please contact me\nInstructions #\rCut the file out in whichever material you prefer.

However, I would argue it’s a lot better for everyone that this is the case.\nThough I don’t agree with everyone’s opinions or want to see stuff like porn and gore on my feed, I welcome the freedom of people being able to speak freely and post whatever content they want (within the law). However, this results in the issue we’re facing today: being recommended potentially harmful content.\nHow Does 𝕏 Decide What to Show You? #\rTo be clear, I’m not an insider at 𝕏, nor do I claim to know how their algorithms work. However, we can take some educated guesses about how the algorithm determines what type of content you may be interested in.\nThese factors likely include:\nAdvertising data Time of day Time spent on the app Posts interacted with Your following list Likes Bookmarks Tricking the Algorithm #\rNow that we have some ideas about what might influence the algorithm, we can try manipulating it to work better for us.\nPlaying It Safe Won’t Work #\rEven if you’re like me and you block trackers and ads by default and keep interactions to a bare minimum, you’ll still get fed content you don’t want. You need to guide the algorithm to correctly place you in the perfect category that suits you.\nIt’s a scenario similar to how sometimes you do want to be tracked. A simple example: I use the Brave browser and Brave’s search engine by default for privacy, but if I want a quick result for the nearest shop that sells a product I’m looking for, I’ll switch to Google and allow it to access my location for better results.\nWhat I Did #\rAdd Muted Words #\rYou may notice that some of the unwanted content is bot-like in nature, always containing the same words, phrases, or even emojis in the post.\nIf you add a muted word, you won’t see posts containing that word again.\nHow to add a muted word in the app\rTap your profile picture and select \u0026ldquo;Settings \u0026amp; Support,\u0026rdquo; then choose \u0026ldquo;Settings and privacy.\u0026rdquo; In the settings menu, find and select \u0026ldquo;Privacy and safety,\u0026rdquo; then choose \u0026ldquo;Mute and block.\u0026rdquo; Tap \u0026ldquo;Muted words\u0026rdquo; and then tap the + button in the corner. Enter the word or phrase you want to mute and choose whether you want it hidden from your timeline, notifications, or both. Select the muting duration: \u0026ldquo;Forever.\u0026rdquo; Tap Save to apply the mute settings. Block Accounts #\rIt may seem obvious, but block the accounts that are the worst offenders.\nThis not only gets rid of those accounts but may also influence the algorithm too to stop showing you content related to the blocked accounts.\nHow to block accounts in the app\rTap the 3-dot menu at the top right of a post. Tap \u0026ldquo;Block @exampleaccount.\u0026rdquo; Bonus tip: You can also do this for ads and sponsored posts on 𝕏 if you want to clean up your advertisements.\nUse \u0026ldquo;Not Interested in This Post\u0026rdquo; #\rThis is probably what does most of the work. In theory, it should tell the algorithm that you don’t want to see this kind of content. It isn’t instant, and you’ll likely scroll down to see a similar post after just telling it you don’t want to see it, but it does help.\nHow to use \"Not Interested in This Post\"\rTap the 3-dot menu at the top right of a post you don’t want to see. Tap \u0026ldquo;Not interested in this post.\u0026rdquo; Actively Search #\rActively search for content you do want to see, even if it’s not at this specific moment in time. Search for something you’re interested in—a subject or topic in the category you want to see more of—and just scroll a few pages, pausing on a couple of posts. Even if you’re not interested in that specific post, pretend you are.\nThis should show the algorithm that you’re not only interested in this kind of content but that it’s actively grabbing your attention, making you stop scrolling and view the content, which is what the app wants you to do.\nRinse and Repeat #\rGoing forward, you’ll want to keep doing this for a few days. It’s a good habit to pick up to keep your feed clean.\nWhile You Wait #\rUntil the algorithm has fully eradicated this unwanted content from your feed, you can browse the \u0026ldquo;Following\u0026rdquo; tab only. This will only show you posts from accounts you follow. Keeping your interactions away from unwanted content will prevent undoing some of the work you’ve done to get rid of it.\nHow Long Does It Take to Update? #\rThe algorithm took around one week to a month to settle in and update fully for me, but since then, it’s been a night-and-day comparison. Porn and gore have completely gone, and it’s now showing me new content that I actually enjoy and often find helpful.\nExtra Steps #\rCheck Your Follower List Check who you’re following to make sure there are no accounts posting this kind of content or interacting with it regularly. If you have hundreds of thousands of accounts that you follow, now may be the time to clean up.\nIf this task is too large, consider creating a new, fresh account and only following accounts you’re actually interested in. Alternatively, use a third-party service to mass unfollow accounts on your behalf.\nCheck Your History Check your post history, like history, and bookmark history, and remove any interactions with content you’re no longer interested in.\nTips Going Forward #\rEngagement Bait #\rLieing to trick others to click the like button\rEngagement bait is a tactic used by businesses and individuals to artificially inflate their popularity on social media, potentially leading to greater reach and more money.\nEngagement bait can take many forms and be hard to spot. Because of this, it’s the hardest one to counter from appearing in your feed. It could be content deliberately posted to infuriate you, content asking for help with obvious questions, straight-up lies, misinformation, and more.\nNow, we all need to make money somehow, and some accounts could be worse offenders depending on the kind of bait they’re posting. However, for me, even the slightest bait, which can seem harmless, is still annoying and a waste of my time. You’ll need to decide where you personally draw the line and unfollow or block accounts accordingly going forward.\nDon’t Let It Sneak Back In #\rMark Zuckerberg Window Stare\rGreat! Your account is free and no longer polluted, but trust me—it will try to come back, and it will be subtle. You’ll need to be vigilant and counter the subtle attempts when they happen.\nFor example, if you suspect a post shown to you is out of the norm and slightly sexual in nature, and you don’t take action on it, it will likely just increase that kind of content being shown to you, and you’ll end up back at square one.\nThe same goes for gore. It will start with subtle videos of altercations, maybe a fight at a McDonald’s somewhere, or even a harmless prank where someone seems like they got hurt. You’ll want to take action on these too, as it can be a slippery slope.\nBe Mindful Of The Content You Interact With #\rYou will want to be mindful of the content your liking \u0026amp; interacting with in the future as it can also influence your feed heavily.\nIf any of this has helped you, feel free to follow me on 𝕏 or Buy Me a Coffee.\nFollow @ashC0DE\n","date":"11 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/x-algorithm/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"How to remove unwanted content from your 𝕏 feed","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"11 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/problem-solving/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Problem Solving","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"11 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/social-media/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Social Media","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"11 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/tutorials/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Tutorials","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"11 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/%F0%9D%95%8F/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"𝕏","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/desktop/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Desktop","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"5 February 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/ios/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"IOS","type":"tags"},{"content":"In today’s digital age, the internet is an integral part of our daily lives. From browsing websites to scrolling through social media, we are constantly exposed to a barrage of advertisements.\nWhile ads are a necessary revenue stream for many platforms, their overabundance and intrusive nature have led to a growing reliance on adblockers.\nThese tools are no longer just a convenience, they are becoming essential for maintaining a positive online experience.\nEliminating Inconvenience #\rOne of the most immediate benefits is the removal of disruptive and time-consuming ads. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, and banners that clutter your screen can make browsing frustrating and slow.\nFor instance, trying to read an article or watch a video often involves closing multiple pop-ups or waiting for ads to finish before accessing the content.\nWATCH AD TO CONTINUE!\rReducing Intrusiveness #\rModern ads are designed to grab your attention, often at the expense of your comfort. From flashing banners to loud video ads that play automatically, the intrusiveness of online advertising can be overwhelming.\nThis is especially true on social media platforms, where ads are seamlessly integrated into your feed, making it difficult to distinguish between organic content and paid promotions.\nPaid Advertisement\rActual Content\rSponsored Content\rProtecting Against Subliminal Influence #\rAdvertising is not just about selling products, it’s about influencing behavior. Ads are crafted to appeal to your emotions, desires, and insecurities, often on a subconscious level. This subliminal messaging can subtly shape your decisions, from what you buy to how you perceive yourself and others.\nFor example, targeted ads on social media platforms use your personal data to present highly tailored content, exploiting your preferences and habits.\nAmerican science fiction action horror film - They Live (1988)\rEnhancing Privacy and Security #\rMany online ads are not just annoying, they can also pose a threat to your privacy and security. Ad networks often track your online activity, collecting data about your browsing habits, interests, and even location.\nThis information is then used to serve you targeted ads, but it can also be shared with third parties or exploited by malicious actors. Some ads even contain malware or phishing scams that can compromise your device and personal information.\ngraph TD;\rA[User Visits Website] --\u003e B[Ads \u0026 Trackers Load];\rB --\u003e C[Data Collection Begins];\rC --\u003e D[Data Sent to Advertisers];\rD --\u003e E[Ad Targeting];\rE --\u003e|User categorized| F[Real-time Ad Bidding];\rF --\u003e G[Ads Are Displayed];\rG --\u003e H[Continuous Tracking];\rH --\u003e|More data gathered| E;\rWebsite Performance \u0026amp; Data Saving #\rAds can significantly slow down website loading times and increase your overall data use, especially on mobile devices.\nHeavy ad scripts and multimedia content consume bandwidth and processing power, leading to longer wait times and a less responsive browsing experience.\nMy recent stats after blocking trackers and ads\rReducing Cognitive Overload #\rThe constant bombardment of ads can lead to cognitive overload, making it harder to focus and process information. This is especially true on social media, where ads are interspersed with posts from friends, news updates, and other content.\nThe sheer volume of stimuli can be exhausting, leading to decision fatigue and a diminished ability to engage meaningfully with the content you care about.\nBritish television sitcom - The IT Crowd\rSupporting Ethical Consumption #\rWhile ads are a primary source of revenue for many websites and platforms, not all advertising practices are ethical.\nSome companies use deceptive tactics, such as clickbait headlines or fake endorsements, to lure users into engaging with their content. Others promote harmful products or perpetuate stereotypes.\nCONGRATULATIONS YOU WON!\rReccomendations #\rNote: Reccomendations are my personal opinion from first hand user experiance and i am not sponsored or affiliated with any company in any way\rBrave #\rhttps://brave.com/\nBrave is a web browser available for Desktop, Android \u0026amp; iOS that does an extremely good job of blocking ads, Brave also stands out as a champion of privacy and user empowerment.\nBuilt on the Chromium engine, Brave offers the familiarity and compatibility of Chrome, combined with robust privacy tools and customization options, making it my top reccomendation for not only blocking ads but also improving your online experiance significantly.\nBrave\u0026rsquo;s commitment to privacy is evident from the moment you start browsing.

While the idea behind it is useful, it comes with one glaring issue: it places an annoying bar permanently at the bottom of your screen. The kicker? Google Lens has been offering this feature for years, via its own app, so there’s really no need for Samsung to bake it into the UI with no easy way to remove it.\nWhile the feature itself can be handy, it feels forced when it’s always visible on your screen, especially when Google Lens already does the same thing without this intrusive bar. It’s one of those situations where users are left feeling like they didn’t ask for this change.\nBut that’s not the only problem. Samsung also added extra gestures tied to the bar. If you’re like me and have been using these gestures long before they became standard in stock UIs, you probably don’t need or want constant reminders on how to use them.\nThe Problem #\rCustomization has always been a big plus for Android. Even back when we didn’t have advanced theming or gestures, people were customizing their devices through custom ROMs and third-party apps. That’s what made Android great—you could make your device truly yours. Over the years, customization has only gotten better, and root access or custom ROMs aren’t as necessary as they once were. However, this new feature seems like a step backward.\nTake the navigation bar, for example. It used to be a fixed, non-removable element that took up precious screen space. It didn’t match the color scheme of your apps, and it wasn’t transparent—it was just a clunky, ugly bar at the bottom of the screen. The modding community (myself included) stepped in and addressed this long before it became a standard option. Gestures replaced the navigation bar, giving us more screen real estate and a cleaner interface. So why are we seeing a return of unnecessary elements like the \u0026ldquo;Circle to Search\u0026rdquo; bar?\nNot a Simple Fix #\rFor some reason, Samsung has made it unnecessarily difficult to remove this change, making it feel almost impossible for the average user who isn’t familiar with Samsung’s settings. But don\u0026rsquo;t worry! If you want to get rid of the \u0026ldquo;Circle to Search\u0026rdquo; bar and restore your home screen to how you like it, just follow the guide below.\nHow to Remove #\rIf you would like to keep the circle to search feature but still remove the bar from your UI then you may skip the first step\rTo completely remove the \u0026ldquo;Circle to Search\u0026rdquo; feature and the persistent bar at the bottom of your screen, follow these steps:\nDisable Circle to Search: #\rOpen your Settings app. Scroll down and tap Display. Tap Navigation Bar. Disable the Circle to Search toggle. Alternatively, you can disable it by going to Settings \u0026gt; Apps \u0026gt; Choose Default Apps \u0026gt; Digital Assistant App and turning off the Digital Assistant option. Install Goodlock and Enable Extra Settings: #\rDownload and open the Goodlock app from the Galaxy Store. Tap on NavStar. Enable Extra Gesture Settings. This will unlock additional navigation bar options that aren\u0026rsquo;t normally visible. Disable Gesture Hints: #\rOpen your Settings app. Scroll down and tap Display. Tap Navigation Bar. Tap More Options. Disable the Gesture Hints toggle. Conclusion #\rAnd that’s it!

The process of teaching oneself new skills, ideas, and concepts not only broadens one\u0026rsquo;s horizons but also instills a deep sense of accomplishment and independence.\nIn this blog post, I will share my experiences with self-teaching and how it has shaped various aspects of my life, from learning to play the electric guitar to developing applications in multiple programming languages.\nFor me, it starts with an idea or sometimes a problem that needs to be solved.\nElectric Guitar #\rOne of the earliest memories of self-teaching is with the electric guitar. In this case, it started with an interest in the heavy metal music genre, specifically fast finger movement and guitar solos.\nWith no formal training, I immersed myself in online tutorials, video lessons, and sheet music. The internet became my classroom, and I learned to appreciate the intricacies of music. Each chord, riff, and melody I mastered brought immense joy and satisfaction.\nThis experience taught me the value of perseverance and patience, qualities that are crucial for any self-learner.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rBullet for My Valentine - Hand of Blood | 10 August 2011\rRepairing CNC Machinery #\rIn my professional life, one area I found self-teaching to be incredibly useful was with CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. I realized the importance of understanding their operation. Self-teaching became my tool to repair these complex machines. I studied manuals, explored use cases, and dissected the machine\u0026rsquo;s software piece by piece to understand their mechanics.\nThis hands-on approach not only honed my technical skills but also instilled a problem-solving mindset that is invaluable in many aspects of life. An example would be a Water-Jet cutting machine my employer had that was having issues. The bed parameters were way out of bounds, and the machine wouldn\u0026rsquo;t move because it thought it was outside the area, which it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe company that they had purchased it from were not the manufacturers but did offer support. They came out and spent a whole day trying to fix the problem and left with a temporary fix of reinstalling the whole operating system (Windows 7) and programs on the machine, which later broke again.\nI then spent an hour or so on the machine, trial and erroring the issue, and ended up cracking the password for the admin settings deep in the machine\u0026rsquo;s software and resetting the parameters manually to fix the issue.\nNow, whenever it had this problem occur, I could fix it and train other operators on how to fix it should it occur again.\nCollection of my CAD designs.\rAndroid Development #\rCuriosity led me to the world of Android app development, where I found joy in reverse engineering apps to create custom designs. By decompiling apps and studying their code, I learned how to modify and enhance them to suit my and many others needs.\nThis endeavor not only improved my programming skills but also gave me insights into user interface design and user experience, which are crucial in today\u0026rsquo;s digital age.\nOverall my projects have amassed millions of user interactions and hundreds of thousands of downloads.\nYou can find a few examples of my work with Android over on XDA:\nStyle your Always On Display Google Fonts for Samsung Nav Bar Remover Samsung Galaxy Smartphone using my customised Always on Display.\rWeb Development #\rAnother opportunity arose through work. My employer was seeking to expand the business and reach new customers. Being well known for my resourcefulness, I was pulled aside to see if I could help with designing an e-commerce website. Having no prior experience, I set out on my journey with web development.\nI started off with simple website builders and produced an eye-catching, fully functional website with updated designs, logos, brochures, as well as the shop, but personally didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy the restrictions placed upon me from using someone else\u0026rsquo;s framework.\nThis sparked the next part of my journey. I found a free course online from freecodecamp.org and began learning web development from there. From simple HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond, I have since built my own website as well as, interactive applications and more recently this blog you are reading by consuming code examples and online courses.\nThe satisfaction of seeing a project come to life from scratch is unparalleled, and it reinforced the idea that with determination and resources, anything is possible.\nMy error 404 page\rC# Programming #\rFreeCodeCamp also offered other professional certificates, and one of them was provided by Microsoft. I wanted to expand my coding knowledge and learn some new coding languages, so I started here. Although it is not advisable to start so early in your coding journey by learning C#, I like a challenge and was motivated to do my best.\nLearning C# on my own was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The certification was well put together and beginner-friendly.\nThe journey of self-teaching C# taught me to appreciate the nuances of different programming paradigms and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code. This led me to developing my first C# Windows application:\nFeed Rate Adjuster\nMy first Windows application built in C#\rPython Programming #\rPython, with its simplicity and versatility, became another language I thought to learn for building various applications.\nSelf-teaching Python was a journey filled with exploration and creativity. I tackled projects ranging from data analysis to encryption algorithms, each one teaching me something new about the language and its capabilities.\nThis experience highlighted the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new challenges. I have since developed my first Python app:\nAsh\u0026rsquo;s Gasket Maker\nMy first application built in Python\rAnd More #\rBeyond the specific examples I have shared, my journey of self-teaching extends into many other areas, some even helping businesses expand into new areas and attract new customers. These endeavors involve projects that, due to contractual obligations, I am unable to disclose. However, they have all contributed to my broader understanding and skills in technology, problem-solving, and creative thinking.\nConclusion #\rSelf-teaching has been a cornerstone of my personal and professional growth. The joy of discovering new skills and mastering them at my own pace has been incredibly fulfilling.\nEach self-taught endeavor has equipped me with the confidence to tackle new challenges and the knowledge that learning is indeed a never-ending journey. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s music, machinery, or programming, the joy of self-teaching lies in the empowerment it brings, turning curiosity into expertise.\n","date":"13 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/self-taught/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Power of Self-Taught Skills","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/cnc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CNC","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rBeing known for my resourcefulness, I was asked to help solve a tricky problem. A local watch shop had quoted hundreds of pounds to replace the battery in a Breitling Navitimer World. The catch? They claimed it required a special tool to access the inside of the watch.\nThe Challenge #\rA Complicated Watch Back Case #\rUpon examining the watch, I quickly identified the issue: the back case was composed of multiple layers of metal, each less than 1mm thick. Some layers were rounded, while others were chamfered, with varying dimensions throughout. To make things more complicated, the case’s intricate design made it impossible to simply pry open with basic tools.\nThe First Idea #\rWith access to a waterjet cutting machine, I figured I could design a custom tool to open the watch. The plan was simple enough: I scanned the back of the watch, loaded the image into CAD software, and traced each layer. Then, I added a 5mm ring around the traced path, along with two handles for better grip and leverage.\nAfter testing the overall design \u0026amp; idea by cutting a test tool out of carbon fibre, I quickly realized this approach wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be as easy as I thought. There wasn’t enough surface area on the case for the tool to grip effectively, and the precision required for the tool to work was more than I had resources for at the time. It was clear that this would need more trial and error to perfect.\nThe Struggle #\rNot giving up, I tried a more direct approach—opening the watch by force. I pressed down with my thumbs in opposite directions, but the case wouldn’t budge. I even tried using a sticky note on the back of the watch to give my thumbs a better grip. Unfortunately, the additional grip didn’t make a difference.\nTo make matters worse, I had recently strained a flexor tendon in my hand, so my grip strength was weaker than usual.\nThe Solution #\rHaving a variety of rubber materials at my disposal, I tried various combinations between my fingers and the watch to gain more traction. Nothing seemed to work.\nThen, I had a breakthrough idea. I grabbed a thick piece of sponge with a slightly adhesive backing. While the adhesive wasn’t very strong, it was enough to provide the right amount of friction. I placed the sponge on the back of the watch, holding the watch in my left palm and using my right palm to push and twist counterclockwise.\nWith just the right amount of grip, I was finally able to unlock the watch! Success!\nConclusion #\rA Lesson in Persistence and Innovation #\rWhat started as a seemingly impossible task ended with a resourceful solution. It wasn’t the smoothest process, but in the end, The battery was replaced without spending a fortune or relying on specialized tools. It was a great reminder that sometimes persistence, creativity, and a little trial and error are all you need to solve even the most complicated problems.\n","date":"9 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/breitling-navitimer/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"How i replaced a Breitling Navitimer Watch battery—Without spending hundreds","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/budget-gaming-pc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Budget Gaming PC","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rA Surprise Find on Facebook Marketplace #\rOne day, my wife came across a motherboard and keyboard being given away for free on Facebook Marketplace. When we picked them up, I was surprised to see that the motherboard still had the CPU installed, along with a WiFi + Bluetooth adapter included in the box. The motherboard was an ASUS H170 PRO GAMING with an Intel i5-7600K CPU installed, and the WiFi card was a GIGABYTE GC-WBAX200. The Plan #\rBuilding a Gaming PC for My Daughter #\rHaving an old Graphics Card (GTX 760 4GB) and a 4K Monitor (BenQ EL2870U) already at my disposal, I decided to build a gaming PC for my 7-year-old daughter. The primary goal was to create a system for school projects and light gaming like Roblox.\nChoosing the Right Components #\rTo make sure I picked the right components, I turned to pcpartpicker.com and used their \u0026ldquo;Builder\u0026rdquo; tool. This handy tool helps simulate building a computer by inputting each individual part. It provides valuable information such as pricing, power consumption, and compatibility.\nAfter entering all my existing parts, I began searching for affordable yet quality components with an appealing aesthetic to match. Here’s what I ultimately chose:\nFinal Component List #\rMotherboard: ASUS H170 PRO GAMING (included in the Facebook Marketplace find) CPU: Intel i5-7600K (installed with the motherboard) WiFi Adapter: GIGABYTE GC-WBAX200 (included in the box) Graphics Card: GTX 760 4GB (already owned) Monitor: BenQ EL2870U 4K Monitor (already owned) Storage: 240GB SSD (taken from an old laptop, swapped with a 120GB drive I had on hand) Case: Kolink Observatory HF Mesh ARGB Power Supply: MSI MAG A550BN RAM: Corsair Vengeance RB PRO 16GB (2 x 8GB) CPU Fan: Thermalright Assasin King 120 I sourced all the new parts from Amazon for quicker delivery and a smoother build process. Building the PC #\rStep-by-Step #\rThe next step was assembling the system. Having built PCs before, I was confident in the process, but I still followed a Linus Tech Tips YouTube video for a refresher on how to install the parts. It helped ensure everything was done correctly, from mounting the motherboard to connecting the power supply.\nOnce assembled, the PC powered on without any issues—success!

I opted for the \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo; model as in my opinion it closer resembles an actual watch.\nThe smartwatch arrived in its original packaging along with the charger and a black silicone strap. I purchased a Stainless Steel silver strap to replace the silicone one, but I observed that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit properly during charging because the strap cannot be opened up and laid flat like the silicone straps.\nThis made me consider how I could create something that fits better and doesn\u0026rsquo;t move around on my desk like the charger does.\nThe Design #\rI began creating the design using a free CAD software called NanoCAD, which I have learned to use through my experience with other projects over the past few years.\nI sourced some 6mm thick scrap wood for the base material and began to take measurements of the watch and the charger to incorporate into my design.
