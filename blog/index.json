From browsing websites to scrolling through social media, we are constantly exposed to a barrage of advertisements.\nWhile ads are a necessary revenue stream for many platforms, their overabundance and intrusive nature have led to a growing reliance on adblockers.\nThese tools are no longer just a convenience, they are becoming essential for maintaining a positive online experience.\nEliminating Inconvenience #\rOne of the most immediate benefits is the removal of disruptive and time-consuming ads. Pop-ups, auto-playing videos, and banners that clutter your screen can make browsing frustrating and slow.\nFor instance, trying to read an article or watch a video often involves closing multiple pop-ups or waiting for ads to finish before accessing the content.\nWATCH AD TO CONTINUE!\rReducing Intrusiveness #\rModern ads are designed to grab your attention, often at the expense of your comfort. From flashing banners to loud video ads that play automatically, the intrusiveness of online advertising can be overwhelming.\nThis is especially true on social media platforms, where ads are seamlessly integrated into your feed, making it difficult to distinguish between organic content and paid promotions.\nPaid Advertisement\rActual Content\rSponsored Content\rProtecting Against Subliminal Influence #\rAdvertising is not just about selling products, it’s about influencing behavior. Ads are crafted to appeal to your emotions, desires, and insecurities, often on a subconscious level. This subliminal messaging can subtly shape your decisions, from what you buy to how you perceive yourself and others.\nFor example, targeted ads on social media platforms use your personal data to present highly tailored content, exploiting your preferences and habits.\nAmerican science fiction action horror film - They Live (1988)\rEnhancing Privacy and Security #\rMany online ads are not just annoying, they can also pose a threat to your privacy and security. Ad networks often track your online activity, collecting data about your browsing habits, interests, and even location.\nThis information is then used to serve you targeted ads, but it can also be shared with third parties or exploited by malicious actors.

While the idea behind it is useful, it comes with one glaring issue: it places an annoying bar permanently at the bottom of your screen. The kicker? Google Lens has been offering this feature for years, via its own app, so there’s really no need for Samsung to bake it into the UI with no easy way to remove it.\nWhile the feature itself can be handy, it feels forced when it’s always visible on your screen, especially when Google Lens already does the same thing without this intrusive bar. It’s one of those situations where users are left feeling like they didn’t ask for this change.\nBut that’s not the only problem. Samsung also added extra gestures tied to the bar. If you’re like me and have been using these gestures long before they became standard in stock UIs, you probably don’t need or want constant reminders on how to use them.\nThe Problem #\rCustomization has always been a big plus for Android. Even back when we didn’t have advanced theming or gestures, people were customizing their devices through custom ROMs and third-party apps. That’s what made Android great—you could make your device truly yours. Over the years, customization has only gotten better, and root access or custom ROMs aren’t as necessary as they once were. However, this new feature seems like a step backward.\nTake the navigation bar, for example. It used to be a fixed, non-removable element that took up precious screen space. It didn’t match the color scheme of your apps, and it wasn’t transparent—it was just a clunky, ugly bar at the bottom of the screen. The modding community (myself included) stepped in and addressed this long before it became a standard option. Gestures replaced the navigation bar, giving us more screen real estate and a cleaner interface. So why are we seeing a return of unnecessary elements like the \u0026ldquo;Circle to Search\u0026rdquo; bar?\nNot a Simple Fix #\rFor some reason, Samsung has made it unnecessarily difficult to remove this change, making it feel almost impossible for the average user who isn’t familiar with Samsung’s settings. But don\u0026rsquo;t worry! If you want to get rid of the \u0026ldquo;Circle to Search\u0026rdquo; bar and restore your home screen to how you like it, just follow the guide below.\nHow to Remove #\rIf you would like to keep the circle to search feature but still remove the bar from your UI then you may skip the first step\rTo completely remove the \u0026ldquo;Circle to Search\u0026rdquo; feature and the persistent bar at the bottom of your screen, follow these steps:\nDisable Circle to Search: #\rOpen your Settings app. Scroll down and tap Display. Tap Navigation Bar. Disable the Circle to Search toggle. Alternatively, you can disable it by going to Settings \u0026gt; Apps \u0026gt; Choose Default Apps \u0026gt; Digital Assistant App and turning off the Digital Assistant option. Install Goodlock and Enable Extra Settings: #\rDownload and open the Goodlock app from the Galaxy Store. Tap on NavStar. Enable Extra Gesture Settings. This will unlock additional navigation bar options that aren\u0026rsquo;t normally visible. Disable Gesture Hints: #\rOpen your Settings app. Scroll down and tap Display. Tap Navigation Bar. Tap More Options. Disable the Gesture Hints toggle. Conclusion #\rAnd that’s it! You’ve successfully removed the \u0026ldquo;Circle to Search\u0026rdquo; bar, and you can now enjoy a cleaner, uncluttered screen while keeping your gestures intact. Customization is all about making your device work for you, so take control and make your phone feel like yours again!

The process of teaching oneself new skills, ideas, and concepts not only broadens one\u0026rsquo;s horizons but also instills a deep sense of accomplishment and independence.\nIn this blog post, I will share my experiences with self-teaching and how it has shaped various aspects of my life, from learning to play the electric guitar to developing applications in multiple programming languages.\nFor me, it starts with an idea or sometimes a problem that needs to be solved.\nElectric Guitar #\rOne of the earliest memories of self-teaching is with the electric guitar. In this case, it started with an interest in the heavy metal music genre, specifically fast finger movement and guitar solos.\nWith no formal training, I immersed myself in online tutorials, video lessons, and sheet music. The internet became my classroom, and I learned to appreciate the intricacies of music. Each chord, riff, and melody I mastered brought immense joy and satisfaction.\nThis experience taught me the value of perseverance and patience, qualities that are crucial for any self-learner.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rBullet for My Valentine - Hand of Blood | 10 August 2011\rRepairing CNC Machinery #\rIn my professional life, one area I found self-teaching to be incredibly useful was with CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. I realized the importance of understanding their operation. Self-teaching became my tool to repair these complex machines. I studied manuals, explored use cases, and dissected the machine\u0026rsquo;s software piece by piece to understand their mechanics.\nThis hands-on approach not only honed my technical skills but also instilled a problem-solving mindset that is invaluable in many aspects of life. An example would be a Water-Jet cutting machine my employer had that was having issues. The bed parameters were way out of bounds, and the machine wouldn\u0026rsquo;t move because it thought it was outside the area, which it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe company that they had purchased it from were not the manufacturers but did offer support. They came out and spent a whole day trying to fix the problem and left with a temporary fix of reinstalling the whole operating system (Windows 7) and programs on the machine, which later broke again.\nI then spent an hour or so on the machine, trial and erroring the issue, and ended up cracking the password for the admin settings deep in the machine\u0026rsquo;s software and resetting the parameters manually to fix the issue.\nNow, whenever it had this problem occur, I could fix it and train other operators on how to fix it should it occur again.\nCollection of my CAD designs.\rAndroid Development #\rCuriosity led me to the world of Android app development, where I found joy in reverse engineering apps to create custom designs. By decompiling apps and studying their code, I learned how to modify and enhance them to suit my and many others needs.\nThis endeavor not only improved my programming skills but also gave me insights into user interface design and user experience, which are crucial in today\u0026rsquo;s digital age.\nOverall my projects have amassed millions of user interactions and hundreds of thousands of downloads.\nYou can find a few examples of my work with Android over on XDA:\nStyle your Always On Display Google Fonts for Samsung Nav Bar Remover Samsung Galaxy Smartphone using my customised Always on Display.\rWeb Development #\rAnother opportunity arose through work. My employer was seeking to expand the business and reach new customers. Being well known for my resourcefulness, I was pulled aside to see if I could help with designing an e-commerce website. Having no prior experience, I set out on my journey with web development.\nI started off with simple website builders and produced an eye-catching, fully functional website with updated designs, logos, brochures, as well as the shop, but personally didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy the restrictions placed upon me from using someone else\u0026rsquo;s framework.\nThis sparked the next part of my journey. I found a free course online from freecodecamp.org and began learning web development from there. From simple HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond, I have since built my own website as well as, interactive applications and more recently this blog you are reading by consuming code examples and online courses.\nThe satisfaction of seeing a project come to life from scratch is unparalleled, and it reinforced the idea that with determination and resources, anything is possible.\nMy error 404 page\rC# Programming #\rFreeCodeCamp also offered other professional certificates, and one of them was provided by Microsoft. I wanted to expand my coding knowledge and learn some new coding languages, so I started here. Although it is not advisable to start so early in your coding journey by learning C#, I like a challenge and was motivated to do my best.\nLearning C# on my own was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The certification was well put together and beginner-friendly.\nThe journey of self-teaching C# taught me to appreciate the nuances of different programming paradigms and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code. This led me to developing my first C# Windows application:\nFeed Rate Adjuster\nMy first Windows application built in C#\rPython Programming #\rPython, with its simplicity and versatility, became another language I thought to learn for building various applications.\nSelf-teaching Python was a journey filled with exploration and creativity. I tackled projects ranging from data analysis to encryption algorithms, each one teaching me something new about the language and its capabilities.\nThis experience highlighted the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new challenges. I have since developed my first Python app:\nAsh\u0026rsquo;s Gasket Maker\nMy first application built in Python\rAnd More #\rBeyond the specific examples I have shared, my journey of self-teaching extends into many other areas, some even helping businesses expand into new areas and attract new customers. These endeavors involve projects that, due to contractual obligations, I am unable to disclose. However, they have all contributed to my broader understanding and skills in technology, problem-solving, and creative thinking.\nConclusion #\rSelf-teaching has been a cornerstone of my personal and professional growth. The joy of discovering new skills and mastering them at my own pace has been incredibly fulfilling.\nEach self-taught endeavor has equipped me with the confidence to tackle new challenges and the knowledge that learning is indeed a never-ending journey. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s music, machinery, or programming, the joy of self-teaching lies in the empowerment it brings, turning curiosity into expertise.\n","date":"13 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/self-taught/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Power of Self-Taught Skills","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/cnc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CNC","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rBeing known for my resourcefulness, I was asked to help solve a tricky problem. A local watch shop had quoted hundreds of pounds to replace the battery in a Breitling Navitimer World. The catch? They claimed it required a special tool to access the inside of the watch.\nThe Challenge #\rA Complicated Watch Back Case #\rUpon examining the watch, I quickly identified the issue: the back case was composed of multiple layers of metal, each less than 1mm thick. Some layers were rounded, while others were chamfered, with varying dimensions throughout. To make things more complicated, the case’s intricate design made it impossible to simply pry open with basic tools.\nThe First Idea #\rWith access to a waterjet cutting machine, I figured I could design a custom tool to open the watch. The plan was simple enough: I scanned the back of the watch, loaded the image into CAD software, and traced each layer. Then, I added a 5mm ring around the traced path, along with two handles for better grip and leverage.\nAfter testing the overall design \u0026amp; idea by cutting a test tool out of carbon fibre, I quickly realized this approach wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be as easy as I thought. There wasn’t enough surface area on the case for the tool to grip effectively, and the precision required for the tool to work was more than I had resources for at the time. It was clear that this would need more trial and error to perfect.\nThe Struggle #\rNot giving up, I tried a more direct approach—opening the watch by force. I pressed down with my thumbs in opposite directions, but the case wouldn’t budge. I even tried using a sticky note on the back of the watch to give my thumbs a better grip. Unfortunately, the additional grip didn’t make a difference.\nTo make matters worse, I had recently strained a flexor tendon in my hand, so my grip strength was weaker than usual.\nThe Solution #\rHaving a variety of rubber materials at my disposal, I tried various combinations between my fingers and the watch to gain more traction. Nothing seemed to work.\nThen, I had a breakthrough idea. I grabbed a thick piece of sponge with a slightly adhesive backing. While the adhesive wasn’t very strong, it was enough to provide the right amount of friction. I placed the sponge on the back of the watch, holding the watch in my left palm and using my right palm to push and twist counterclockwise.\nWith just the right amount of grip, I was finally able to unlock the watch! Success!\nConclusion #\rA Lesson in Persistence and Innovation #\rWhat started as a seemingly impossible task ended with a resourceful solution. It wasn’t the smoothest process, but in the end, The battery was replaced without spending a fortune or relying on specialized tools. It was a great reminder that sometimes persistence, creativity, and a little trial and error are all you need to solve even the most complicated problems.\n","date":"9 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/breitling-navitimer/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"How i replaced a Breitling Navitimer Watch battery—Without spending hundreds","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/budget-gaming-pc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Budget Gaming PC","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rA Surprise Find on Facebook Marketplace #\rOne day, my wife came across a motherboard and keyboard being given away for free on Facebook Marketplace.

For instance, the slot in the center of (1) is precisely wide enough to accommodate a USB port placed sideways, and the charger hole in (2) matches the diameter of the charger.\nManufacturing #\rOnce the file was contoured for cutting and converted into G-Code using CNC software, I used a Water Jet Cutting machine to cut it.\nAfter lightly sanding the edges of the wood, I put the pieces together and applied some glue to the joints in the process.\nTo prevent any damage to the watch, I placed some foam between the front shelf and the middle charging point for it to rest on. I also added some abrasion material to the bottom of the wood to keep it from sliding around on my desk.\nCompleted, all that was required was to thread the USB cable through the central slot, pull it out, insert the charger into the opening, and plug it in.\n","date":"28 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/smart-watch-dock/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"DIY Samsung Galaxy Watch charging dock","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/designs/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Designs","type":"categories"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rI have personally designed and manufactured almost everything in my office.

The slots are 9mm wide, so either use material that is 8.5 - 9mm thick, or alter the slots to fit your thickness of material.

You may notice that i am also using a Spigen case, The case is pretty slim although it should still fit a tab S6 well enough without a case, or inside a different case to my own providing its not too heavy duty.\nEnjoy!\n","date":"25 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/tabletstand/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"DIY Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite stand","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"25 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/categories/downloads/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Downloads","type":"categories"},{"content":"","date":"25 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/dxf/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"DXF","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rMy youngest daughter currently likes all things Super Mario, as well as Luigi\u0026rsquo;s mansion so i created this layered BOO! cut out for her.
