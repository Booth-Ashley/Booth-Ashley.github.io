The process of teaching oneself new skills, ideas, and concepts not only broadens one\u0026rsquo;s horizons but also instills a deep sense of accomplishment and independence.\nIn this blog post, I will share my experiences with self-teaching and how it has shaped various aspects of my life, from learning to play the electric guitar to developing applications in multiple programming languages.\nFor me, it starts with an idea or sometimes a problem that needs to be solved.\nElectric Guitar #\rOne of the earliest memories of self-teaching is with the electric guitar. In this case, it started with an interest in the heavy metal music genre, specifically fast finger movement and guitar solos.\nWith no formal training, I immersed myself in online tutorials, video lessons, and sheet music. The internet became my classroom, and I learned to appreciate the intricacies of music. Each chord, riff, and melody I mastered brought immense joy and satisfaction.\nThis experience taught me the value of perseverance and patience, qualities that are crucial for any self-learner.\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\rBullet for My Valentine - Hand of Blood | 10 August 2011\rRepairing CNC Machinery #\rIn my professional life, one area I found self-teaching to be incredibly useful was with CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. I realized the importance of understanding their operation. Self-teaching became my tool to repair these complex machines. I studied manuals, explored use cases, and dissected the machine\u0026rsquo;s software piece by piece to understand their mechanics.\nThis hands-on approach not only honed my technical skills but also instilled a problem-solving mindset that is invaluable in many aspects of life. An example would be a Water-Jet cutting machine my employer had that was having issues. The bed parameters were way out of bounds, and the machine wouldn\u0026rsquo;t move because it thought it was outside the area, which it wasn\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe company that they had purchased it from were not the manufacturers but did offer support. They came out and spent a whole day trying to fix the problem and left with a temporary fix of reinstalling the whole operating system (Windows 7) and programs on the machine, which later broke again.\nI then spent an hour or so on the machine, trial and erroring the issue, and ended up cracking the password for the admin settings deep in the machine\u0026rsquo;s software and resetting the parameters manually to fix the issue.\nNow, whenever it had this problem occur, I could fix it and train other operators on how to fix it should it occur again.\nCollection of my CAD designs.\rAndroid Development #\rCuriosity led me to the world of Android app development, where I found joy in reverse engineering apps to create custom designs. By decompiling apps and studying their code, I learned how to modify and enhance them to suit my and many others needs.\nThis endeavor not only improved my programming skills but also gave me insights into user interface design and user experience, which are crucial in today\u0026rsquo;s digital age.\nOverall my projects have amassed millions of user interactions and hundreds of thousands of downloads.\nYou can find a few examples of my work with Android over on XDA:\nStyle your Always On Display Google Fonts for Samsung Nav Bar Remover Samsung Galaxy Smartphone using my customised Always on Display.\rWeb Development #\rAnother opportunity arose through work. My employer was seeking to expand the business and reach new customers. Being well known for my resourcefulness, I was pulled aside to see if I could help with designing an e-commerce website. Having no prior experience, I set out on my journey with web development.\nI started off with simple website builders and produced an eye-catching, fully functional website with updated designs, logos, brochures, as well as the shop, but personally didn\u0026rsquo;t enjoy the restrictions placed upon me from using someone else\u0026rsquo;s framework.\nThis sparked the next part of my journey. I found a free course online from freecodecamp.org and began learning web development from there. From simple HTML and CSS to JavaScript and beyond, I have since built my own website as well as, interactive applications and more recently this blog you are reading by consuming code examples and online courses.\nThe satisfaction of seeing a project come to life from scratch is unparalleled, and it reinforced the idea that with determination and resources, anything is possible.\nMy error 404 page\rC# Programming #\rFreeCodeCamp also offered other professional certificates, and one of them was provided by Microsoft. I wanted to expand my coding knowledge and learn some new coding languages, so I started here. Although it is not advisable to start so early in your coding journey by learning C#, I like a challenge and was motivated to do my best.\nLearning C# on my own was a challenging yet rewarding experience. The certification was well put together and beginner-friendly.\nThe journey of self-teaching C# taught me to appreciate the nuances of different programming paradigms and the importance of writing clean, maintainable code. This led me to developing my first C# Windows application:\nFeed Rate Adjuster\nMy first Windows application built in C#\rPython Programming #\rPython, with its simplicity and versatility, became another language I thought to learn for building various applications.\nSelf-teaching Python was a journey filled with exploration and creativity. I tackled projects ranging from data analysis to encryption algorithms, each one teaching me something new about the language and its capabilities.\nThis experience highlighted the importance of continuous learning and adapting to new challenges. I have since developed my first Python app:\nAsh\u0026rsquo;s Gasket Maker\nMy first application built in Python\rAnd More #\rBeyond the specific examples I have shared, my journey of self-teaching extends into many other areas, some even helping businesses expand into new areas and attract new customers. These endeavors involve projects that, due to contractual obligations, I am unable to disclose. However, they have all contributed to my broader understanding and skills in technology, problem-solving, and creative thinking.\nConclusion #\rSelf-teaching has been a cornerstone of my personal and professional growth. The joy of discovering new skills and mastering them at my own pace has been incredibly fulfilling.\nEach self-taught endeavor has equipped me with the confidence to tackle new challenges and the knowledge that learning is indeed a never-ending journey. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s music, machinery, or programming, the joy of self-teaching lies in the empowerment it brings, turning curiosity into expertise.\n","date":"13 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/self-taught/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"The Power of Self-Taught Skills","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"9 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/cnc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"CNC","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rBeing known for my resourcefulness, I was asked to help solve a tricky problem. A local watch shop had quoted hundreds of pounds to replace the battery in a Breitling Navitimer World. The catch? They claimed it required a special tool to access the inside of the watch.\nThe Challenge #\rA Complicated Watch Back Case #\rUpon examining the watch, I quickly identified the issue: the back case was composed of multiple layers of metal, each less than 1mm thick. Some layers were rounded, while others were chamfered, with varying dimensions throughout. To make things more complicated, the case’s intricate design made it impossible to simply pry open with basic tools.\nThe First Idea #\rWith access to a waterjet cutting machine, I figured I could design a custom tool to open the watch. The plan was simple enough: I scanned the back of the watch, loaded the image into CAD software, and traced each layer. Then, I added a 5mm ring around the traced path, along with two handles for better grip and leverage.\nAfter testing the overall design \u0026amp; idea by cutting a test tool out of carbon fibre, I quickly realized this approach wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be as easy as I thought. There wasn’t enough surface area on the case for the tool to grip effectively, and the precision required for the tool to work was more than I had resources for at the time. It was clear that this would need more trial and error to perfect.\nThe Struggle #\rNot giving up, I tried a more direct approach—opening the watch by force. I pressed down with my thumbs in opposite directions, but the case wouldn’t budge. I even tried using a sticky note on the back of the watch to give my thumbs a better grip. Unfortunately, the additional grip didn’t make a difference.\nTo make matters worse, I had recently strained a flexor tendon in my hand, so my grip strength was weaker than usual.\nThe Solution #\rHaving a variety of rubber materials at my disposal, I tried various combinations between my fingers and the watch to gain more traction. Nothing seemed to work.\nThen, I had a breakthrough idea. I grabbed a thick piece of sponge with a slightly adhesive backing. While the adhesive wasn’t very strong, it was enough to provide the right amount of friction. I placed the sponge on the back of the watch, holding the watch in my left palm and using my right palm to push and twist counterclockwise.\nWith just the right amount of grip, I was finally able to unlock the watch! Success!\nConclusion #\rA Lesson in Persistence and Innovation #\rWhat started as a seemingly impossible task ended with a resourceful solution. It wasn’t the smoothest process, but in the end, The battery was replaced without spending a fortune or relying on specialized tools. It was a great reminder that sometimes persistence, creativity, and a little trial and error are all you need to solve even the most complicated problems.\n","date":"9 January 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/posts/breitling-navitimer/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"How i replaced a Breitling Navitimer Watch battery—Without spending hundreds","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"20 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/blog/tags/budget-gaming-pc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Budget Gaming PC","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rIntroduction #\rA Surprise Find on Facebook Marketplace #\rOne day, my wife came across a motherboard and keyboard being given away for free on Facebook Marketplace. When we picked them up, I was surprised to see that the motherboard still had the CPU installed, along with a WiFi + Bluetooth adapter included in the box. The motherboard was an ASUS H170 PRO GAMING with an Intel i5-7600K CPU installed, and the WiFi card was a GIGABYTE GC-WBAX200. The Plan #\rBuilding a Gaming PC for My Daughter #\rHaving an old Graphics Card (GTX 760 4GB) and a 4K Monitor (BenQ EL2870U) already at my disposal, I decided to build a gaming PC for my 7-year-old daughter. The primary goal was to create a system for school projects and light gaming like Roblox.\nChoosing the Right Components #\rTo make sure I picked the right components, I turned to pcpartpicker.com and used their \u0026ldquo;Builder\u0026rdquo; tool. This handy tool helps simulate building a computer by inputting each individual part. It provides valuable information such as pricing, power consumption, and compatibility.\nAfter entering all my existing parts, I began searching for affordable yet quality components with an appealing aesthetic to match. Here’s what I ultimately chose:\nFinal Component List #\rMotherboard: ASUS H170 PRO GAMING (included in the Facebook Marketplace find) CPU: Intel i5-7600K (installed with the motherboard) WiFi Adapter: GIGABYTE GC-WBAX200 (included in the box) Graphics Card: GTX 760 4GB (already owned) Monitor: BenQ EL2870U 4K Monitor (already owned) Storage: 240GB SSD (taken from an old laptop, swapped with a 120GB drive I had on hand) Case: Kolink Observatory HF Mesh ARGB Power Supply: MSI MAG A550BN RAM: Corsair Vengeance RB PRO 16GB (2 x 8GB) CPU Fan: Thermalright Assasin King 120 I sourced all the new parts from Amazon for quicker delivery and a smoother build process. Building the PC #\rStep-by-Step #\rThe next step was assembling the system. Having built PCs before, I was confident in the process, but I still followed a Linus Tech Tips YouTube video for a refresher on how to install the parts. It helped ensure everything was done correctly, from mounting the motherboard to connecting the power supply.\nOnce assembled, the PC powered on without any issues—success!

I opted for the \u0026ldquo;Classic\u0026rdquo; model as in my opinion it closer resembles an actual watch.\nThe smartwatch arrived in its original packaging along with the charger and a black silicone strap. I purchased a Stainless Steel silver strap to replace the silicone one, but I observed that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit properly during charging because the strap cannot be opened up and laid flat like the silicone straps.\nThis made me consider how I could create something that fits better and doesn\u0026rsquo;t move around on my desk like the charger does.\nThe Design #\rI began creating the design using a free CAD software called NanoCAD, which I have learned to use through my experience with other projects over the past few years.\nI sourced some 6mm thick scrap wood for the base material and began to take measurements of the watch and the charger to incorporate into my design.
